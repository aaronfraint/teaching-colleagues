# Environment Setup

Although you're welcome to use the python environment manager of your choice, these instructions will use the `conda` command, installed via `miniconda`. Most commands will install packages from the `conda-forge` channel.


These instructions were tested on 8/21/2019 using Windows 10 and macOS 10.14.6.


### Create and activate the virtual environment
```shell script
(base) conda create -n teaching python=3.8
(base) conda activate teaching
```

### Install open-source packages

#### Notebooks
```shell script
(teaching) conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

#### Data analysis
```shell script
(teaching) conda install -c conda-forge geopandas
(teaching) conda install -c conda-forge seaborn
```

#### SQL Databases
```shell script
(teaching) conda install -c conda-forge psycopg2
(teaching) conda install -c conda-forge geoalchemy2
```

#### Excel
```shell script
(teaching) conda install -c conda-forge xlrd
(teaching) conda install -c conda-forge xlsxwriter
```

# IDE Setup
After building your `conda` environment, create a new project in PyCharm from this
repo's parent folder. Open the IDE settings and point the project interpreter to
the one you just created.
