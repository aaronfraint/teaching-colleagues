# # Parse pedestrian volumes from an Excel-based Turning Movement Count
#
# We have a folder full of Excel count data and companion PDFs. We need to parse each one to pull out a Pedestrian-specific volume number that we can then use to scale point sizes on a GIS map.
#
# Things to note:
# - Data does not start on Row 1
# - There are typically 4 columns with Ped data, but there could be non-standard intersections with more or fewer legs
#
# ### Use jupyter to prototype a solution:

# +
import pandas as pd
import os
import datetime as datetime

data_folder = r"C:\Users\ryantaylorgratzer\Documents\Active_Projects\Data Science\Counts\Counts\Count Reports 6-17-19"
test_file = os.path.join(data_folder, "1 LICK MILL BLVD & TASMAN DR.xls")
# -

# Read the file starting at line 10
df = pd.read_excel(test_file, sheet_name="Vehicles", header=9)

# +
#rename the Start Time column to start_time, and convert the times to hours, since that's all we need for the buckets
df.rename(columns = {'Start Time':'start_time'}, inplace = True)
df['start_time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['start_time']).dt.hour

print(df['start_time'])


# +
# Make a variable that will hold the total across all "Peds" columns
running_total = 0
morning_peak = 0
midday = 0
evening_peak = 0

# Get a list of all "Peds" column names
ped_cols = [x for x in df.columns if "Peds" in x]

# +
# For each column, get the sum and add it to the running total
for col in ped_cols:
    col_total = df[col].sum()

    running_total += col_total
        
print(running_total)

# +
# For each column, get the sum of morning peak rows (7-10am) and add it to the morning peak total
for col in ped_cols:
    
    col_total = df.loc[(df['start_time'] >= 7) & (df['start_time'] <= 9)]
    
    col_total = col_total[col].sum()
                                   
    morning_peak += col_total
        
print(morning_peak)

# +
# For each column, get the sum of midday rows (10am-3pm) and add it to the midday total
for col in ped_cols:
    
    col_total = df.loc[(df['start_time'] >= 10) & (df['start_time'] <= 14)]
    
    col_total = col_total[col].sum()

    midday += col_total
        
print(midday)

# +
# For each column, get the sum of evening peak rows (3pm-6pm) and add it to the evening peak total
for col in ped_cols:
    col_total = df.loc[(df['start_time'] >= 15) & (df['start_time'] <= 18)]
    
    col_total = col_total[col].sum()

    evening_peak += col_total
        
print(evening_peak)

# ### Once you have a working solution, compartmentalize it within a function:
#
# Notice that I've left a few ``TODO`` items in there. Figure out how to add those in after you've reviewed the code

# +
# Now do all the above as a function

def get_ped_total(excel_count_file):

    # modify the return value so that the function returns the daily total along with the time bucket totals
    
    return daily_total, morning_peak, midday, evening_peak

# ### Now we're ready to iterate over all Excel files and pull results out

for f in os.listdir(data_folder):
    xls_path = os.path.join(xlsx_folder, f)
    total = get_ped_total(xls_path)
    
    print(total, f)

# # ``TODO``
#
# - Iterate over all files, getting full day and time bucket data
# - Wrangle all results into a ``pandas.DataFrame``. Each location (/excel file) becomes a row in this table.
# - Save this dataframe to ``.csv``
