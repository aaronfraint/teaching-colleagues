# postgis_helpers

This module faciltates interactions with PostgreSQL databases and both spatial / non-spatial data.

It depends upon a number of other python libraries which should already be installed.

To install the latest version of `postgis_helpers`, activate the `teaching` environment and use `pip` and `git` to install:

```
(base) $ conda activate teaching

(teaching) $ pip install git+https://github.com/aaronfraint/postgis-helpers.git
```
